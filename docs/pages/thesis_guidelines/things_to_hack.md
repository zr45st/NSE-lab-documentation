There are many potential targets for security assessments. Here are some suggestions: 

- Power grid asset management equipment
- Smart electricity meters
- SCADA control system equipment such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs)
- Google PlayStore 100M-user apps (https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-adds-all-android-apps-with-100m-installs-to-its-bug-bounty-program/ , https://youtu.be/e9PdX-NmCSg)
- Open source, like linux, nginx, apache, openssl, kvm, bash, vim, imagemagick, etc.
- Health-related equipment, such as blood glucose meters, pulse meters, even pace makers, if we can get a hold of one
- Garmin sports watches seem to feature many attack vectors, e.g. featuring their own app store.
